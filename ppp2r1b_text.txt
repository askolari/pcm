Mutations of PPP2R1B gene are not frequent in cervical cancer.,17449237:PPP2R1B, together with NPAT and CUL5, is implicated in the deregulation of the cell-cycle and apoptosis regulators and in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.,17540176:These observations identify PP2A Abeta as a tumor suppressor gene that transforms immortalized human cells by regulating the function of RalA.,19951945:Data show that upon hypoxia, the TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 was inhibited, although Smad2 remained phosphorylated, and Smad3 was dephosphorylated by PP2A.,20133745:Data show that PR65-dominated fluctuations of PP2A have the effect of opening and closing the enzyme's substrate binding/catalysis interface, as well as altering the positions of certain catalytic residues.,21420167:Data show that the only gene that was expressed, although not at high levels, in all the cells carrying the 11q23.1 amplification was PPP2R1B.,23588898:For PPP2R1B, no mutations were detected in our samples.,26247730:MicroRNA-587 antagonizes 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and confers drug resistance by regulating PPP2R1B expression in colorectal cancer.,32310826:Exosomal miR-200c suppresses
